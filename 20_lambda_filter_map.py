# LAMBDA FUNCTIONS
#
#	- They are like anonymous functions, syntactic sugar that Python adds to shorten
#	  the code; it just consist in sum up a normal function into a lambda function
#
#	- All you can do with a lambda function can be done with a normal function,
#	  but it doesn't work in reverse, not all you can do with a normal function can
#	  be done using lambda functions. For example, a lambda function can't have
#	  flow control statements such as conditional structures or loops
#
#	- Syntax:
#				lambda [input_arguments]: [result_expression]
#

#
# FILTER FUNCTION
#
#	- Considered as high order function
#
#	- Checks which elements in a collection meets a condition and returns an iterator 
#	  with the elements that satisfy that condition; i.e.: filters the collection

#
# MAP FUNCTION
#
#	- Considered as high order function
#
#	- Applies a specified function to each element of an iterable (list, tuple, etc.),
#	  and return ANOTHER list with the results after apply the function
#
#   - It returns a map object, which is lazy evaluated, so each result of the function over the iterable element,
#     it's calculated on demand when it's required, in subsequent callings to the iterable.
